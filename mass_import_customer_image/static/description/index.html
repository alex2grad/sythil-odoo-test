Designed for migrating images from non odoo databases which maps the filename with a field in a database table e.g. 576.jpg maps to customer with id 576<br>
<Br>
Using the module<br>
1.	Zip all the photos you wish to mass import<br>
2.  Upload the zip to your server.<br>
3.	Go to Sales->Mass Import Customer Photos<br>
4.	Upload the file, set mapping field to the field that matches the filename(without extension)<br>
5.	View MICP History for any errors that occured during the import process<br>
6.	If neccassary reupload images that failed to import after issues have been fixed<br>

Planned features<br>
1. multi file upload, so people don't have to upload the zip to the server<br>
2. allow mapping to non int fields e.g. restaurant_name.jpg<br>
